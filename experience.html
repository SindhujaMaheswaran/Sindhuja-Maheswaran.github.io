                <h3>Data Collection, Storage, and Access</h3>
                <p>Across my projects, I effectively utilized Python, Tableau, and TensorFlow to manage and retrieve large datasets, supporting
                   data-driven analyses and insights. For example, in the Crime Classification Based on Geographical Area project, I processed over
                   a million records, efficiently handling data using Python and TensorFlow libraries to prepare and structure data for modeling. 
                   Similarly, in the Zillow House Price Prediction project,I used PySpark to manage and process extensive Zillow datasets, demonstrating 
                   my expertise in data storage and access mechanisms..</p>
            </div>

            <div class="certification-box">
                <h3>Insight Generation Across Contexts</h3>
                <p>Each project provided context-specific insights, showcasing my ability to cover the full data science lifecycle from data preparation
                   to actionable outcomes. In the Crime Classification project, my work on classifying crime data based on location identified high-risk
                   areas, offering valuable insights for public safety. Meanwhile, the Natural Disasters and Economic Impact in the USA project analyzed
                   disaster trends, identifying economic impact patterns that can inform policy and community resilience strategies. The Zillow House Price 
                   Prediction project offered actionable insights on housing market trends, aiding stakeholders in strategic decision-making for property
                   investments..</p>
            </div>

            <div class="certification-box">
                <h3>Visualization and Predictive Modeling</h3>
                <p>I applied advanced visualization and predictive modeling techniques to transform raw data into impactful insights. Tableau dashboards
                    in the Natural Disasters and Economic Impact project enabled stakeholders to visually interpret complex data on disaster frequencies 
                    and severities. In Crime Classification, I developed predictive models, such as CNN, gradient boosting, and logistic regression, which
                    improved classification accuracy by 70%, helping to identify high-risk zones. For the Zillow House Price Prediction project, I utilized
                    models like ARIMA, KNN, and CNN for housing price forecasts, showcasing predictive modeling expertise in trend analysis and forecasting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="certification-box">
                <h3>Programming Proficiency</h3>
                <p>My programming skills in Python, R, and PySpark enabled me to execute complex analyses, automate workflows, and build predictive models across
                   projects. In Crime Classification, I relied on Python libraries (Sklearn, TensorFlow) to power model training and performance enhancement. The
                   Zillow House Price Prediction project utilized PySpark for large-scale data handling and Python for implementing ARIMA and CNN models, 
                   highlighting my versatility with both statistical and deep learning frameworks..</p>
            </div>

            <div class="certification-box">
                <h3>Communication of Insights</h3>
                <p>Each project emphasized the importance of designing accessible visual dashboards and effectively presenting insights. For instance, in the
                   Natural Disasters project, I designed visual dashboards with Tableau, making disaster-related data clear for non-technical stakeholders. 
                   Similarly, in Crime Classification, I communicated findings on high-risk areas through visualizations, making complex model results 
                   interpretable for public safety officials..</p>
            </div>

            <div class="certification-box">
                <h3>Ethics in Data Science</h3>
                <p>Throughout these projects, I addressed ethical considerations by prioritizing data transparency, privacy, and unbiased model outcomes. 
                   In Crime Classification, ethical considerations included addressing potential biases in crime data to ensure fair model predictions.
                   Similarly, in the Natural Disasters and Economic Impact project, transparency and ethical data use were paramount, especially given the 
                   social and economic implications of disaster impact analysis. By implementing careful data handling practices, I ensured my work aligned
                   with responsible data science standards.</p>
