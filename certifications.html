                <h3>Data Collection, Storage, and Access</h3>
                <p>Across your projects, you effectively utilized Python, Tableau, and TensorFlow to manage and retrieve large datasets,
                   supporting data-driven analyses and insights. Examples include the Crime Classification project, where over a million 
                   records were processed, and the Zillow House Price Prediction project, which leveraged PySpark to handle extensive datasets.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="certification-box">
                <h3>Insight Generation Across Contexts</h3>
                <p>Each project provided context-specific insights, from identifying high-risk areas in the Crime Classification project to
                   analyzing economic impacts in the Natural Disasters project. These insights assist stakeholders in making strategic,
                   data-driven decisions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="certification-box">
                <h3>Visualization and Predictive Modeling</h3>
                <p>Advanced visualization and predictive modeling transformed raw data into insights. Projects like Natural Disasters and 
                   Economic Impact used Tableau for data visualization, while models such as CNN and ARIMA were utilized in predictive tasks 
                   for housing market trends.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="certification-box">
                <h3>Programming Proficiency</h3>
                <p>Proficiency in Python, R, and PySpark enabled complex analyses and model implementation. Python libraries like Sklearn and
                   TensorFlow were applied in Crime Classification, while PySpark and ARIMA were used in the Zillow House Price Prediction project.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="certification-box">
                <h3>Communication of Insights</h3>
                <p>Insights were effectively communicated through dashboards and visualizations. For example, in the Natural Disasters project,
                   dashboards in Tableau helped non-technical stakeholders interpret complex data, ensuring accessible, actionable information.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="certification-box">
                <h3>Ethics in Data Science</h3>
                <p>Ethical considerations were prioritized, including transparency, privacy, and bias mitigation. Crime Classification focused on fair 
                   model predictions, while the Natural Disasters project emphasized transparency given its societal impact.</p>
