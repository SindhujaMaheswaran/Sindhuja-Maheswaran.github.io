            <h3>Master of Applied Data Science</h3>
            <p><strong>Institution:</strong> Syracuse University, New York, USA (Expected December 2024)</p>
            <p class="description">
                I am completing a Master of Applied Data Science at Syracuse University, expected in December 2024,
                where I have honed expertise in data analytics, machine learning, and advanced statistical methods,
                equipping me to derive impactful insights from complex datasets. This program has provided hands-on 
                experience in predictive modeling, data visualization, and scalable data engineering, preparing me to 
                address real-world business challenges with innovative data-driven solutions. My academic journey began 
                with a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science from Anna University, India (May 2018), which gave me a robust 
                foundation in software development, algorithm design, and problem-solving. This combination of deep 
                technical knowledge and applied analytics experience positions me well to contribute effectively to 
                dynamic, data-centric environments and drive strategic decision-making for impactful business outcomes.
